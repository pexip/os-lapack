 This package contains a set of programs which test the integrity of an
 installed blas-compatible shared library. These programs may therefore be used
 to test the libraries provided by the blas package as well as those provided
 by the libatlas3-base and libopenblas-base packages. The programs are
 dynamically linked -- one can explicitly select a library to test by setting
 the libblas.so.3 alternative, or by using the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or LD_PRELOAD
 environment variables. Likewise, one can display the library selected using
 the ldd program in an identical environment.
