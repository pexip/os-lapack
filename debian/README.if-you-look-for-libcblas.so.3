  * README if you look for libcblas.so
    ==================================

    Debian science team maintainers have merged the CBLAS ABI into
    the libblas.so shared object. Everything you need from libcblas.so
    can be found in libblas.so . Please link your program against it
    instead. See also

    This README file has an unusual name because we expect users to
    find it by this way:

      $ apt-file search libcblas
      /usr/share/doc/libblas-dev/README.if-you-look-for-libcblas.so
      /usr/lib/...
